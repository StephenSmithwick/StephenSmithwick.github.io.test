    <h2>Profile</h2>
    <p>
      I am a Principal Software Engineer with a technical focus currently responsible for designing,
      implementing, monitoring, scaling and optimizing software services within the Integration Domain
      at Qantas Airways. I am passionate about my work which mostly involves exploring, innovating and implementing
      key decisions around our solutions, managing team members and working with stakeholders.  I also love to code
      and learn new technologies: from Android Apps for my son in Kotlin to Scala courses and meetups, I happily geek out with
      my team and colleagues.
