  <h2>Profile</h2>
    <p>
      I am a Principal Software Engineer with a technical focus currently responsible for designing,
      implementing, monitoring, scaling and optimizing software services within the Integration Domain
      at Qantas Airways. I am passionate about my work which mostly involves exploring, innovating and implementing
      key decisions around our solutions, managing team members and working with stakeholders.  I also love to code
      and learn new technologies: from Android Apps for my son in Kotlin to Scala courses and meetups, I happily geek out with
      my team and colleagues.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a Principal in the Integration Domain, I also take on the slightly unusual role of Product Owner.
      I collaborate with my stakeholders to understand their priorities, work with my team to identify the
      complexity of the work and strive to build a timely solution which delivers what is needed without
      cutting corners. I believe that it is healthy to have a grand vision for the product your team is
      building.  We work with consumers to test that vision and build out to meet their requirements.
      Along the way we inevitably tweak the vision as we learn more from experience and our customers.
    </p>

    <p>
      They say perfect is the enemy of good.  I take from that the idea to be striving for perfection, but being aware that
      having a great solution in the end doesn't mean being perfect from the start.  We start by building what is needed now
      and leave the path open for a better solution when the customer's requirements call for it.
    </p>

    <p>
      I ensure my team and I are deliberate about how our decisions move us towards our goals and are aware of potential tradeoffs. I
      am always willing to hear ideas from within or outside the team that challenge our assumptions.  Ultimately we achieve
      our goals because I listen to my team and others, especially when they have a unique perspective.
    </p>

    <p>
      I build team excellence through the agile practice of continual improvement. We improve our standards
      as a team through regular retrospectives, but more importantly, we improve because I work to build a
      culture of collaboration where we focus on fixing a problem and not who is to blame.  I encourage every
      member of the team to innovate and share, lifting up each other's performance. I have a regular one-on-one
      with everyone who reports to me.  We talk about their goals and KPIs, we discuss strategies to meet those goals,
      I solicit feedback and we assign actions to each other. I find when you know what your team members goals are,
      it's easy to look out for opportunities and build excellence.
    </p>

      Established the Sydney chapter and ran several hackathons.
      This role included working with charities to define their problems and guiding volunteers to ensure
      that projects were effectively deployed. An example project, FirstStop, was developed in conjunction
      with the Blue Mountains Bush Fire Crisis team and Sydney University to allow users affected by disaster
      to share their personal data with aid agencies using a QR code (June 2014).
